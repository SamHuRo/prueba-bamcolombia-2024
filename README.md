Attached are 3 bases (.csv files with UTF-8 encoding) to develop the technical test: 
 - **exa_barrios_cali:** A list with the neighborhoods (zones) of the city of Cali. 
 - **exa_dispositivos_cali:** A list with physical channel devices in Cali (branches, dispenser and multifunctional ATM, banking correspondents, PAC and POS establishments), including their geographic position. 
 - **exa_trx_clients:** Contains the number and amount of transactions of various types of customers, such as national citizens, foreigners, companies, among others; made through the devices in different channels.

The test consists of processing this data to answer the following questions: 

1. What are the neighborhoods where the movements of at least 51% of the total money transacted by each customer are concentrated? Consider that clients may have more than one neighborhood. 
2. What are the 5 neighborhoods where the largest number of unique customers make transactions on POS devices? The answer should include the number of unique customers associated with these neighborhoods. 
3. What are the 10 unique distances of the devices farthest from each other belonging to the Caney neighborhood? The answer should be in kilometers.
